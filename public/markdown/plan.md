##Problems I am currently working on or thinking about

* **Newsroom Development** A team of designers and developers
embedded in the newsroom at the [Wall Street Journal](http://wsj.com),
specializing in building reusable applications, systems and
processes for the benefit of the editorial and technology staff.

experiment with the phonegap estimote plugins.

* **Unnamed card game project** It's like your day job, but a card game.

* **Unnamed long-term website for planting trees** A tree growing website.
Visit the site, plant a tree. It grows in real time.

* **Geekdesk / iBeacon hack** When approaching an adjustable-height desk,
desk should adjust to your current level of activity automatically.
